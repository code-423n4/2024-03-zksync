how different is this audit scope from previous audit?

Only one way to find out, by auditing

a lot of changes :chefskiss:


[03/08/2024 02:45] 0x11singh99
Hi @Vlad B | zkSync Last time when zksync came only L1 contracts was in scope for gas optimizations. But this time no note in readme mentioning about this so we can assume All L1 ,L2 contracts are in scope for gas optimizations   Or that note was missing by mistake ?
Please clarify  Thanks


[03/08/2024 07:42] vladbochok
Hey @0x11singh99, all L1, L2, and system contracts are in scope for gas optimizations. Please note, L2 contracts and system contracts gas optimisations should be measured according to EraVM environment as a gas model is different.

holy shit thats massive codebase


[03/08/2024 12:33] forgebyola
are you up to the challenge


[03/08/2024 12:34] forgebyola
That's how legends are made


[03/08/2024 17:40] Deleted User
why this syntax ``uint256 constant L1_GAS_PER_PUBDATA_BYTE = $(L1_GAS_PER_PUBDATA_BYTE);``   &  it compiled  for the team ?


[03/09/2024 09:51] vladbochok
We are using a solpp preprocessor. This is the program that runs before compilation and can modify code. In order to run the tests please use one-liners from the repo.


[03/09/2024 09:59] Deleted User
& if i only want to compile them with ``forge b``  how can i do, i dont want to execute the tests, just to compile to create my tests


[03/09/2024 15:27] koloz193
You would first run the preprocessor with `npx hardhat solpp` in the folder and then you can compile with `forge build`


[03/09/2024 16:51] hgq2wnl
well that's my mind blown lol. This project is wild, hats off to devs.

For this codebase I think they're using v5, you can see that in the log. Check your dependencies again


[03/13/2024 12:44] antond3
Are you sure that the test node is in a clear state? Can you try to rerun it right before the tests?

AFAIK phalcon block explorer by blocksec also support zksync, so you can take the zksync tx hash and put it there

was there no bot race for this?


[03/18/2024 20:05] 7a4raf
at `Compressor::_verifyValueCompression` why is the result expected to be unchanged after operation type 3 : Transformation ?


[03/18/2024 20:49] forgebyola
Hm where are the sponsors pls

looks like we have zero knowledge about it

the transform operation just declares what the final value should be unrelated to the initial value

[03/19/2024 09:29] forgebyola
There's usually a bot-race done at the beginning of most audits, I can't find it on the audit page


[03/19/2024 09:29] forgebyola
I would like to check it if there's one


[03/19/2024 09:30] forgebyola
Also, please check my pvt thread

I have a couple of questions

no, there was no bot race, however, there are oos findings spotted by Analyzer. see the message here: https://discord.com/channels/810916927919620096/1214267101947109479/1215389011909157004
